# 🐍 3D Snake - Three.js Game

A browser-based 3D arcade game where you control a snake trapped inside a transparent cube. Fly freely in 3D space, eat apples to grow, and escape the cube to advance to the next level.

## Features (To Implement)

### Core Gameplay
- ✅ Base file structure created
- ⬜ 3D snake movement and rendering
- ⬜ Mouse-controlled steering (pitch + yaw)
- ⬜ Continuous forward movement
- ⬜ Apple spawning and collection
- ⬜ Snake growth system

### Camera System
- ⬜ Third-person follow camera
- ⬜ Smooth lerp-based tracking
- ⬜ Camera shake effects

### Collision Detection
- ⬜ Snake-apple collision
- ⬜ Snake-self collision
- ⬜ Snake-wall collision

### Level System
- ⬜ Progressive difficulty scaling
- ⬜ Cube breaking effects
- ⬜ Speed and size progression

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js** - 3D graphics library
- **WebGL** - Rendering via Three.js
- **JavaScript (ES6 Modules)** - Game logic
- **HTML5 Canvas** - Display surface

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. The game will automatically initialize
3. Use mouse movement to steer the snake
4. Collect apples to grow and escape the cube

## Configuration

Game settings can be modified in `src/config.js`:
- Snake speed and growth
- Camera follow distance
- Collision parameters
- Level difficulty settings
- Visual parameters

## Notes

- All base files are created with TODO comments for implementation
- No game logic is implemented yet - files are structure only
- Uses Three.js from CDN via importmap
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

- Sound effects and background music
- Particle effects for apple collection and cube breaking
- Power-ups and special items
- Leaderboard system
- Mobile controls support
